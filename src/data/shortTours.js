      "For many of us, discovering a love of boating and being out on the water started when we were youngsters being pulled on a tube behind the family boat. If that was how you came to love boating, you can probably still remember your first time on a tube. It was glorious, wasn’t it? Boat tubes started out pretty humbly, with someone lashing one end of a rope to a truck inner tube and the other end to a boat. That’s how water tubing was born.",

      "Requiring minimal skill level, tubing is the easiest of all tow sports, and as such is a sport truly accessible to the whole family. But that’s not to say it’s not dramatic! From gliding across the surface of the wake, smoothly enjoying the rush of the water flow by, to an adrenaline fuelled white-knuckle rides that surpasses any theme park experience, the choice is yours.",
